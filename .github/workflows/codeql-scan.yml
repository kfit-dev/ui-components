run-name: "CodeQL scan on ${{ github.head_ref || github.ref_name }}"

# For CodeQL scan, below are the optimal ways to do it
# 1. Perform scan on weekly basis for master/main branch. Preferably on Monday
# 2. Perform scan on each PR to master/main branch.
# 3. If necessary, we can do scan for each push event in master/main branch. 

on:
  pull_request:
    # Only runs if PR on master or main branch
    branches: 
      - "master"
      - "main" 
  # Runs on every Monday 8am MYT (12am UTC)
  schedule:
    - cron: '00 00 * * 1'
